# Week 3 Homework *Website Presentation*

For this presentation I chose BestBuy.com. This is because it is a site I frequent that seems to always look pretty up to date.  
Upon investigation I noticed a few things that were  interesting. On the surface with all the paint it looks pretty good.  
It doesn't follow a symantic approach to html. Rather they use divs and iframes everywhere. CLasses are used to divide the  
various sections. The css is basic. It does however work well to make the page look good and work right.
___
Killing JavaScript on the page has no real effect. The page is not dependent on JavaScript.
___
Killing CSS does have an effect. When you turn off CSS the page goes to straight HTML.

Now the one thing the developers did quite well is evident when turning of CSS. The site is highly accessible when in pure HTML.  
You can easily find what you are looking for by scrolling down the page and reading the headlines. The pure text version reads  
like a craigslist page, but you can find what you need. 
+ HTML is basic divs and frames. Not symantic at all.
+ CSS is essential to the look, but function is not effected by CSS
+ JavaScript is used, but disabiling it has little to no effect on the page
